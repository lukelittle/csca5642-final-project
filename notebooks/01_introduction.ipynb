    "## Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Basketball is a game of decisions. Every time a player has the ball, they need to decide: Should I shoot? Pass? Drive? And if they shoot, what are their chances of making it?\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional basketball analytics often uses simple statistics and predetermined court zones to answer these questions. For example, analysts might divide the court into areas like \"corner 3,\" \"top of the key,\" or \"restricted area,\" and calculate shooting percentages for each zone.\n",
    "\n",
    "But this approach has limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Arbitrary Zones**: The court divisions are created by humans and might not reflect natural shooting patterns\n",
    "2. **Missing Context**: Simple percentages don't account for defenders, game situation, or player fatigue\n",
    "3. **Limited Personalization**: Players have unique shooting styles that get averaged out\n",
    "4. **Static Analysis**: The dynamic flow of the game gets lost\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where deep learning comes in. Instead of relying on human-defined zones and simple statistics, we can use neural networks to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Learn optimal court representations directly from millions of shots\n",
    "- Capture each player's unique shooting tendencies\n",
    "- Include game context like score, time remaining, and momentum\n",
    "- Provide personalized insights for players and teams"

    "## Our Research Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we're trying to answer several key questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **How does court location affect shot success?** Beyond simple distance, what spatial patterns exist in shooting effectiveness?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **What makes each player unique?** Can we capture individual shooting tendencies in a way that allows meaningful comparison?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **How does game context matter?** How do factors like score differential, time remaining, and recent performance affect shooting?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Can we combine these factors effectively?** How can we integrate spatial, player, and contextual information to make better predictions?\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **What strategic insights can we gain?** How has NBA shooting strategy evolved, and what patterns lead to success?"

    "## Our Data\n",
    "\n",
    "We're using three comprehensive datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **NBA Shots Dataset**: Over 4.2 million shots from 2004-2024, including details on shot location, type, and outcome. This is our primary dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **NBA Injury Stats Dataset**: 23,450 injuries from 1951-2023, which helps us understand player availability and performance context.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **NBA Team Statistics Dataset**: Comprehensive team performance metrics that provide defensive context and enable team-level analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these datasets give us a complete picture of NBA shooting over two decades."

    "## Our Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "We're using several deep learning techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to process spatial shot data and identify location-specific patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of this like a basketball coach with perfect memory who has watched millions of shots from every spot on the court and learned which locations are most effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Player Embeddings** to create vector representations of player shooting tendencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine creating a \"basketball DNA\" for each player that captures their unique shooting style in a way that lets us compare players mathematically.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Neural Networks** to incorporate game context like quarter, time remaining, and score margin.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is like understanding how the game situation affects shooting - how players perform differently in different quarters or when they're up by 20 versus down by 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Multi-branch Architecture** to combine different types of features and capture their interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This helps us understand how spatial, player, and context features work together to influence shot success - like knowing that certain players excel in specific court locations during particular game situations."

    "3. **Identify key factors** that influence shot success in different situations\n",
