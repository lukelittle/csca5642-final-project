    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature engineering is a critical step in our NBA shot prediction project. While our raw data contains valuable information, transforming and combining this data into meaningful features can significantly improve our model's predictive power.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we create several categories of features:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Spatial Features**: Derived from court coordinates, these features capture the geometric aspects of shooting, including distance from basket, angle, and court zones. Spatial features are expected to be among the most important predictors of shot success.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Game Context Features**: These features capture the situational aspects of each shot, including time remaining, quarter, score margin, and \"clutch\" situations. Game context provides important information about the pressure and strategic considerations for each shot.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Historical Shot Features**: These features incorporate a player's past shooting performance from similar locations, providing a baseline expectation for shot success based on historical patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Player Performance Features**: These features capture player-specific metrics like true shooting percentage, usage rate, and career stage, helping our model understand individual player tendencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Team Features**: These features describe team characteristics like win percentage, offensive/defensive ratings, and playing style, providing context about the team environment for each shot.\n",
    "\n",
    "By engineering these features, we aim to provide our models with rich, meaningful information that captures the multidimensional nature of basketball shooting. We expect spatial features and player-specific features to be particularly important, based on basketball domain knowledge and our exploratory data analysis."
